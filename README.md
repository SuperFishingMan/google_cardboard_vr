I've had a curiosity about virtual reality, especially after trying the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/">Oculus Rift</a> at CES this year. But when I saw <a href="https://vr.google.com/cardboard/">Google Cardboard</a> for $10, I couldn't believe my eyes. Virtual reality for $10 bucks? Get the heck outta here. </br>

After traveling through the world while sitting in my living room, I knew it was the Google Cardboard was legit. With that, I was off to figure out how to develop my own virtual reality experience. Here's how I did it!

## Getting Started
The simplest way to experience Google Cardboard is by downloading a compatible app on your smart phone and experiencing VR through the cardboard viewer. Now since I wanted to go deeper and build a VR app, I needed a little help.

A fantastic tool to dip your toe into Virtual Reality is <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>. It is where you can mix the visuals of your VR world with the rules of that world (ie the code).

Below is the visual rendering of my maze game example, which I built using their platform. Unity gives you tools to build out a world that is three dimensional, which has a learning curve, but so much easier using their tools.

After creating the world, you have code the world. By writing in C# or JS, you make the rules of the game. Does it need gravity? How fast do you want to walk? Sound effects? Check out the special Unity Syntax <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting/c-vs-js-syntax?playlist=17117">here</a> .</br>

From there, I exported it to XCode to put it on my iPhone (there will be a different exporting process for Android or Google phones) and there you have it!
